# Pac-Man

This is a Pac-Man replica with map generation made in python with pygame library

This is my first python project.
I just wanted to learn this language, so this is not a large thing.
I built it in 10 days, and I'm pretty proud of myself.
Most interesting part about it is map generation.
It has more or less complicated map generation algorithm,
because there are some rules that all maps should obey.

1). All passages are 1 block wide

2). No dead-ends

3). No unreachable pockets
